# CST8152-Compilers
Developed the front end of a compiler for the PLATYPUS programming language, using C.

This course was an introduction to the basic principles and development cycle for developing a functional compiler using one programming language to translate text into another. 

A front end compiler for the PLATYPUS programming language created by our professor. Using a buffer, scanner, and parser. 
Tools used:
- MS Visual Studio
- Notepad++
Knowledge implemented:
- function pointers
- reference and memory management
- regular expressions
- lexical and syntactic analysis
- parse trees
- developing of a finite automaton
- Left recursion and transformations for fixing grammar to fit a top down parse tree.
